## üîå Wi-Fi Adapter Used: Alfa AWUS036NHA (Atheros AR9271)

### üì¶ Device Overview

The [**Alfa AWUS036NHA**](https://www.alfa.com.tw/products_show.php?pc=34&ps=201) is a high-performance USB Wi-Fi adapter powered by the **Atheros AR9271** chipset. It is widely used in wireless security research due to its excellent compatibility with Linux and powerful wireless performance.

| Feature              | Description                            |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Chipset**          | Atheros AR9271                         |
| **Wi-Fi Standard**   | IEEE 802.11b/g/n (2.4 GHz only)        |
| **Max Speed**        | Up to 150 Mbps                         |
| **Antenna**          | 5 dBi RP-SMA detachable (upgradeable)  |
| **Interface**        | USB 2.0 (Mini-B)                       |
| **OS Compatibility** | Linux, Windows (via 3rd party drivers) |
| **Modes Supported**  | Monitor Mode, Packet Injection         |

### ‚úÖ Why This Adapter Is Used

- Monitor mode and packet injection support out-of-the-box.
- Fully supported by the `ath9k_htc` driver in most Linux distros, including Kali Linux.
- Ideal for use with tools like `aircrack-ng`, `snek_ap`, `hostapd`, and other Wi-Fi audit frameworks.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **Single-interface limitation**: This device cannot reliably split into two simultaneous virtual interfaces (e.g., AP + client) due to hardware constraints.
- **Only 2.4 GHz**: No support for 5 GHz bands.
- Creating additional interfaces using commands like:
  ```bash
  sudo iw dev wlan1 interface add wlansnake type station
  ```
  may work temporarily, but dual-mode operation is **not stable or recommended**.

### üõ†Ô∏è Setup Example (Kali Linux)

```bash
# Install firmware if not already available
sudo apt update && sudo apt install firmware-atheros

# Enable monitor mode
sudo ip link set wlan1 down
sudo iw dev wlan1 set type monitor
sudo ip link set wlan1 up
```

### üß™ Used With: `snek_ap`

This adapter is tested and fully compatible with `snek_ap`, allowing:

- Rogue AP attacks
- Beacon/Probe flooding
- Packet injection-based attacks
